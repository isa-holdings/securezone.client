# Installing NVM (Node Version Manager)

Node Version Manager, also known as NVM is used to control and manage multiple active versions of Node.js in one system. It is a command line utility and a bash script that allows programmers to shift between different versions of Node.js. They will be able to install any version using a single command and setting defaults using the command line utility.

- These installation instructions are specifically for a CentOS 8 server.
- We are using a Liquid Web VPS server running Cent OS 8 64-bit Core-managed server.
- We are logged in as the Root user.

First, we will need to make sure all of our packages are up to date:

```shell
yum update
or
dnf update
```

## Installing NVM (Node Version Manager)

Next, we will need to run the following NVM installation script. This will install the latest version of NVM from GitHub.

```shell
[root@host ~]# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 13527  100 13527    0     0  60932      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 61208
=> Downloading nvm as script to '/root/.nvm'

=> Appending nvm source string to /root/.bashrc
=> Appending bash_completion source string to /root/.bashrc
=> Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
[root@host ~]#

## Finish Update

Once the script completes without errors, we need to run a source command to immediately implement the changes.

```shell
[root@host ~]# source ~/.bash_profile
[root@host ~]#
```

## Select Node.js Version
Now NVM is ready to use to install the various versions of Node.JS on our system. To find out all the available versions of Node.JS, we will run the following command. This command will produce a long list of available versions including the LTS versions. LTS stands for Long Term Support.

```shell
$ nvm list-remote
       v12.13.0   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.13.1   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.14.0   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.14.1   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.15.0   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.16.0   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.16.1   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.16.2   (LTS: Erbium)
       v12.16.3   (Latest LTS: Erbium)
        v13.0.0
        v13.0.1
        v13.1.0
        v13.2.0
        v13.3.0
        v13.4.0
        v13.5.0
        v13.6.0
        v13.7.0
        v13.8.0
        v13.9.0
       v13.10.0
       v13.10.1
       v13.11.0
       v13.12.0
       v13.13.0
       v13.14.0
        v14.0.0
        v14.1.0
        v14.2.0
[root@host ~]#
```

## Install Node.js

Next, install the latest version of Node.js from the v13 release by running the nvm install 13 command. The output should look something like this.

root@host:~# nvm install 13
Downloading and installing node v13.14.0...
Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v13.14.0/node-v13.14.0-linux-x64.tar.xz...
################################################################################################################## 100.0%
Computing checksum with sha256sum
Checksums matched!
Now using node v13.14.0 (npm v6.14.4)
Creating default alias: default -> 13 (-> v13.14.0)
root@host:~#
```

## Verify the Installation

To review which version of Node.js is currently active, we will run the following command.

```shell
[root@host ~]# nvm current
v13.14.0
[root@host ~]#
```

## Switch Between `Node.js` versions Using `NVM`

`NVM` allows the user to manage multiple versions of Node.js. For example, to install the latest stable version of `NVM`, we will run the following command.

```shell
root@host:~# `nvm` install stable
Downloading and installing node v14.2.0...
Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.2.0/node-v14.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz...
######################################################################100.0%
Computing checksum with sha256sum
Checksums matched!
Now using node v14.2.0 (npm v6.14.4)
root@host:~#
```

Installing a new version of `Node.js` automatically switches from the currently active version to the new updated version. Observe the output of the nvm current command now.

```shell
root@host:~# nvm current
v14.2.0
```

Now that there are two versions of `Node.js` available. To use `v13`, we will run the following command to switch back to v13

```shell
root@host:~# nvm use v13
Now using node v13.14.0 (npm v6.14.4)
root@host:~#
```

Lastly, we can always use the nvm help command to get us started on with further `node.js` management options.

```shell
nvm help
```

`NVM` makes installing and managing different versions of `Node.js` effortless. Now that `Node.js` is installed, your server environment is primed and ready to begin developing your `Node.js` application!
