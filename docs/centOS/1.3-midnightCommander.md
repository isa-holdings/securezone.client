# 1.3 Midnight Commander

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

I recommend using Midnight Commander for easy file navigation, edit and more

```shell
yum install mc
```

It does have a few dependencies so just accept them and then run MC with

```shell
mc

# When in MC you can press Ctrl + O to switch to normal terminal
```
