# 1.7 Install Composer

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

To quickly install Composer in the current directory, run the following script in your terminal. To automate the installation, use the [guide on installing Composer programmatically](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md).

```shell
> php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
> php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '906a84df04cea2aa72f40b5f787e49f22d4c2f19492ac310e8cba5b96ac8b64115ac402c8cd292b8a03482574915d1a8') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
> php composer-setup.php
> php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

This installer script will simply check some `php.ini` settings, warn you if they are set incorrectly, and then download the latest `composer.phar` in the current directory. The 4 lines above will, in order:

- Download the installer to the current directory
- Verify the installer SHA-384
- Run the installer
- Remove the installer

Most likely, you want to put the `composer.phar` into a directory on your PATH, so you can simply call `composer` from any directory (Global install), using for example:

```shell
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
