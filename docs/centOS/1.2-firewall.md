# 1.2 Firewall

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

For a dev server you can disable the firewall

```shell
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl status firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
# Verify that the firewall is disabled
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

*Masking the Firewall Daemon Service*
By now, our Firewall has been disabled permanently, which means that it will not be enabled automatically even after restarting your system; rather, you will have to manually enable it; however, at times, it happens that any other process or service running on your CentOS 8 system may manage to enable your Firewall. You can stop this from happening by masking your Firewall daemon by executing the command stated below in your CentOS 8 terminal:

```shell
sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld
```

But if you wanted to leave the firewall active then use the following commands

For httpd

```shell
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
