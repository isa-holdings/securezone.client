# 1.5 Install Mysql

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

On CentOS 8, MySQL version 8 is available from the default repositories.

Run the following command to install the `mysql-server` package and a number of its dependencies:

```shell
sudo dnf install mysql-server
```

```shell
Output

Is this ok [y/N]: y
```

With that, MySQL is installed on your server but it isn’t yet operational. The package you just installed configures MySQL to run as a `systemd` service named `mysqld.service`. In order to use MySQL, you will need to start it with the `systemctl` command:

```shell
sudo systemctl start mysqld.service
```

To check that the service is running correctly, run the following command. Note that for many `systemctl` commands — including `start` and, as shown here, `status` — you don’t need to include `.service` after the service name:

If MySQL was successfully started, the output will show that the MySQL service is active:

```shell
mysqld.service - MySQL 8.0 database server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-03-12 14:07:41 UTC; 1min 7s ago
 Main PID: 15723 (mysqld)
   Status: "Server is operational"
    Tasks: 38 (limit: 5056)
   Memory: 474.2M
   CGroup: /system.slice/mysqld.service
           └─15723 /usr/libexec/mysqld --basedir=/usr

```

```shell
sudo systemctl status mysqld
# Put mysql in startup
systemctl enable mysqld.service
```

Then run the `mysql_secure_installation` to create the root user

- When asked to only allow strong passwords, -no
- When asked to set root password set to root

When asked to disallow remote root access say no

#### Add Remote Access to Database

Allow access from remote PC, run the following commands

```sql
$ mysql -u root -proot
CREATE USER 'root'@'%'
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_name.* TO 'root'@'%' 
```

Or make super user with

```mysql
GRANT EXECUTE, PROCESS, SELECT, SHOW DATABASES, SHOW VIEW, ALTER, ALTER ROUTINE,
    CREATE, CREATE ROUTINE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, DELETE, DROP,
    EVENT, INDEX, INSERT, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, UPDATE, CREATE USER, FILE,
    LOCK TABLES, RELOAD, REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE, SHUTDOWN,
    SUPER
        ON *.* TO root@'%'
    WITH GRANT OPTION;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
