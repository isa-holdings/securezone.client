# 1.10 Apache

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

When typing the command `httpd` the first time you might get the following error

```shell
AH00526: Syntax error on line 85 of /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:
SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt' does not exist or is empty
```

To fix this, simply restart `httpd`

```shell
systemctl restart httpd
```
