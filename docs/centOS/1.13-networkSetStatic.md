For this guide, we will set up a static IP address for the eth1 interface on CentOS 8 server. The goal is to set up the eth1 interface with the following details:

- Interface: eth1
- IP Address: 192.168.10.100
- Gateway: 192.168.10.1
- DNS: 1.1.1.1

## Prerequisites

On the new version of CentOS 8, there are some major changes related the Networking. For the new version CentOS 8, all configuration related networking is managed by the NetworkManager service. And the NetworkManager provided the TUI (Text User Interface) based application that allows you to create and edit the network configuration, its called 'nmtui'.
Nmtui is a curses-based tui application for interacting with the NetworkManager. The nmtui is a text-based user interface application, can be run on the Terminal shell for managing the NetworkManager.

First, check the 'nmtui' package on the server and make sure it's installed.

```shell
rpm -qa | grep NetworkManager
```

Ensure you get the 'NetworkManager-tui' package on the list.
