# 2.2 Grant Permissions

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

All the files and directories are owned by the `root` user. If you want to allow the other user to access and modify the files in the Document Root then you can change the ownership with the `chown` command.

```shell
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/securezone.co.za/public_html
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/api.securezone.co.za/public_html
```

Now we have to change the permission to ensure that read permission allowed to the general web directory. So, that all the content inside the public_html can be served correctly.

```shell
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
```
