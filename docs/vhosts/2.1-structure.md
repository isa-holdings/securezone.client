# 2.1 Create the Directory Structure

[_Back to Index_](../README.md)

First, create the directory structure in which we hold the website data to the serve on the internet for the visitors.

The Default Document Root location is `/var/www/`. Apache always looks at `/var/www/` to find the content of the site. If you want to change the default path of Document Root. Simply edit the main Apache configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.

To change the Document root edit the configuration file and the change the path of `Document Root` and the `Directory` of the `Document Root`.

Create the Directories using the `mkdir` command with `-p` extension that allow us to create a folder with a nested folder inside it.

In these directories we will create the `public_html` that hold our actual website files. It's not compulsory that you have to put the files `public_html` folder.

If you want to host multiple website then you have to create multiple directories for each of the Domain.

```shell
mkdir -p /var/www/securezone.co.za/public_html
mkdir -p /var/www/api.securezone.co.za/public_html
```
