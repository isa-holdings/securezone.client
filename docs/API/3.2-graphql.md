# 3.2 GraphQL with Laravel and Lighthouse

I didn't want to pollute the project with a bunch of test code so I created another vhost called `graphql.dev`

On this vhost I installed a demo project that can be found at [https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse-tutorial.git](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse-tutorial.git)

```shell
cd /var/www/graph.securezone.co.za/public_html/
git clone https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse-tutorial.git .
composer update
```

The tutorial is an implementation of a blog

Add `.env` file

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file and change the DB details

### SSL Error

Your connection is not private
Attackers might be trying to steal your information from 

A quick way to bypass this message — open Advanced and see if you have a “proceed to website” option.
If not, you can try typing `badidea` or `thisisunsafe` directly in chrome on the same page. Don’t do this unless the site is one you trust or develop. The text `badidea` and `thisisunsafe` says a lot!

### Run DB Migrations

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

Then use the factories to create some demo data

```shell
php artisan tinker

# Create new User Factory
php artisan make:factory UserFactory --model=User
# Creating 10 users
$users = User::factory()->count(10)->create();

# Create new Post Factory
php artisan make:factory PostFactory --model=Post
# Creating 10 Posts
$posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

# Create new Comment Factory
php artisan make:factory PostFactory --model=Post
# Creating 10 Comments
$posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();
```

Now you can install the GraphQL Playground to experiment with GraphQL

```shell
cd /var/www/graph.securezone.co.za/public_html
composer require mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground
```

You can then access the playground `http://server-ip/graphql-playground`
