# Google 2 FA Authentication

The `2FA` needs a few things that I did not have time to setup and one of those things are a working `mail server`, so I disabled the `2FA` by updating the following

`config/google2fa.php`

```php
<?php

return [

    /*
     * Enable / disable Google2FA.
     */
    'enabled' => env('OTP_ENABLED', true),

    // Update the line above to false to disable the 2 FA

```
