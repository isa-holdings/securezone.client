# 5.1 Local dev Server X11 Forwarding

When you run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` then it will start a dev server on port 8000 or 8080 or whatever

There url's are not always available remotely so to get past this you can run Firefox with X11 forwarding

For windows install [MobaXTerm](npm install -D @quasar/vite-plugin sass@1.32.0)

Install Firefox on CentOS 8

```shell
wget -O- "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US" | tar -jx -C /usr/local/
```

Create a symlink to a newly downloaded `/usr/local/firefox/firefox` executable.

```shell
ln -s /usr/local/firefox/firefox /usr/bin/firefox
```

Start the latest Firefox browser from GUI menu or by executing the `firefox` command. 

```shell
firefox
```

Open MobaXTerm and Create Open new Tab, Then manually open a new SSH connection to your server but with the -X directive

```shell
ssh -X user@server-id

# Set environment variable for display
export DISPLAY="127.0.0.:10"
firefox
```

It might give you some errors the first time, but then just close the process and try again, a `Linux` looking windows should pop up out of nowhere... You are now running a Local Browser on the `Centos 8 Server` but viewing the `window` in `windows`, thanks to `X11 Forwarding`
