# 4.7 Vue Auto Routes

[Githib Repo](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages)

File system based routing for Vue 3 applications using `Vite`

By default a page is a Vue component exported from a .vue or .js file in the src/pages directory.

## 4.7.1 Install

```shell
yarn add -D vite-plugin-pages@beta
yarn add vue-router@next
```

## 4.7.2 Vite config
Add to your `vite.config.js`:

```js
import Pages from "vite-plugin-pages";

export default {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    Pages({
        dirs: [
            { dir: "src/pages", baseRoute: "" },
            { dir: "src/features/**/pages", baseRoute: "features" },
            { dir: "src/admin/pages", baseRoute: "admin" },
        ],
        exclude: ["**/components/*.vue"],
        extendRoute(route, parent) {
            if (route.path === "/") {
                // Index is unauthenticated.
                return route;
            }

            // Augment the route with meta that indicates that the route requires authentication.
            return {
                ...route,
                meta: { auth: true },
            };
        }
    }),
  ],
};
```

Add to your `main.js`

You can access the generated routes by importing the ~pages module in your application.

```js
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import routes from "~pages";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  routes,
});
```

Pages automatically generates an array of routes for you to plug-in to your instance of Vue Router. These routes are determined by the structure of the files in your pages directory. Simply create `.vue` files in your pages directory and routes will automatically be created for you, no additional configuration required!

## 4.7.4 Usage

## 4.7.4.1 Basic Routing

Pages will automatically map files from your pages directory to a route with the same name:

```
src/pages/users.vue -> /users
src/pages/users/profile.vue -> /users/profile
src/pages/settings.vue -> /settings
```

## 4.7.4.2 Index Routes
Files with the name index are treated as the index page of a route:

```
src/pages/index.vue -> /
src/pages/users/index.vue -> /users
```

## 4.7.4.3 Dynamic Routes
Dynamic routes are denoted using square brackets. Both directories and pages can be dynamic:

```
src/pages/users/[id].vue -> /users/:id (/users/one)
src/pages/[user]/settings.vue -> /:user/settings (/one/settings)
```

Any dynamic parameters will be passed to the page as props. For example, given the file src/pages/users/[id].vue, the route /users/abc will be passed the following props:

```json
{ "id": "abc" }
```

## 4.7.4.4 Nested Routes
We can make use of Vue Routers child routes to create nested layouts. The parent component can be defined by giving it the same name as the directory that contains your child routes.

For example, this directory structure:

```
src/pages/
  ├── users/
  │  ├── [id].vue
  │  └── index.vue
  └── users.vue
```

will result in this routes configuration:

```js
[
  {
    path: '/users',
    component: '/src/pages/users.vue',
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        component: '/src/pages/users/index.vue',
        name: 'users'
      },
      {
        path: ':id',
        component: '/src/pages/users/[id].vue',
        name: 'users-id'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## 4.7.4.5 Catch-all Routes

Catch-all routes are denoted with square brackets containing an ellipsis:

```js
src/pages/[...all].vue -> /* (/non-existent-page)
```

The text after the ellipsis will be used both to name the route, and as the name of the prop in which the route parameters are passed.
