# 4.15 Critters CSS

Critters is a plugin that inlines your app's critical CSS and lazy-loads the rest.

It's a little different from other options, because it doesn't use a headless browser to render content. This tradeoff allows Critters to be very fast and lightweight. It also means Critters inlines all CSS rules used by your document, rather than only those needed for above-the-fold content. For alternatives, see Similar Libraries.

Critters' design makes it a good fit when inlining critical CSS for prerendered/SSR'd Single Page Applications. It was developed to be an excellent compliment to prerender-loader, combining to dramatically improve first paint time for most Single Page Applications.

    .blue { color: blue }
  </style>
  <div class="blue">I'm Blue</div>
`;
