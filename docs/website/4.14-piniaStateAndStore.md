# 4.14 Pinia - State Management & Data Store

[Website and More Docs](https://pinia.esm.dev/)

## 4.14.1 Description
Pinia is a store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages. If you are familiar with the Composition API, you might be thinking you can already share a global state with a simple export const state = reactive({}). This is true for single page applications but exposes your application to security vulnerabilities if it is server side rendered. But even in small single page applications, you get a lot from using Pinia:

- Devtools support
  - A timeline to track actions, mutations  
  - Stores appear in components where they are used
  - Time travel and easier debugging
- Hot module replacement
  - Modify your stores without reloading your page
  - Keep any existing state while developing
- Plugins: extend Pinia features with plugins
- Proper TypeScript support or autocompletion for JS users
- Server Side Rendering Support

## 4.14.2 Install

```shell
yarn add pinia
# or with npm
npm install pinia
```

Update `main.js`

```js
import { createPinia } from 'pinia'

app.use(createPinia())
```

## 4.14.3 Defining a Store

Before diving into core concepts, we need to know that a store is defined using defineStore() and that it requires a unique name, passed as the first argument:

```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

// useStore could be anything like useUser, useCart
// the first argument is a unique id of the store across your application
export const useStore = defineStore('main', {
  // other options...
})
```

This name, also referred as id, is necessary and is used by Pinia to connect the store to the devtools. Naming the returned function use... is a convention across composables to make its usage idiomatic.

## 4.14.4 Using the store

We are defining a store because the store won't be created until useStore() is called inside of setup():

```js
import { useStore } from '@/stores/counter'

export default {
  setup() {
    const store = useStore()

    return {
      // you can return the whole store instance to use it in the template
      store,
    }
  },
}
```
You can define as many stores as you want and you should define each store in a different file to get the most out of pinia (like automatically allow your bundle to code split and TypeScript inference).

If you are not using setup components yet, you can still use Pinia with map helpers.

Once the store is instantiated, you can access any property defined in state, getters, and actions directly on the store. We will see these in detail in the next pages but autocompletion will help you.

Note that store is an object wrapped with reactive, meaning there is no need to write .value after getters but, like props in setup, we cannot destructure it:

```js
export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const store = useStore()
    // ❌ This won't work because it breaks reactivity
    // it's the same as destructuring from `props`
    const { name, doubleCount } = store

    name // "eduardo"
    doubleCount // 2

    return {
      // will always be "eduardo"
      name,
      // will always be 2
      doubleCount,
      // this one will be reactive
      doubleValue: computed(() => store.doubleCount),
      }
  },
})
```

In order to extract properties from the store while keeping its reactivity, you need to use storeToRefs(). It will create refs for any reactive property. This is useful when you are only using state from the store but not calling any action:

```js
import { storeToRefs } from 'pinia'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const store = useStore()
    // `name` and `doubleCount` are reactive refs
    // This will also create refs for properties added by plugins
    // but skip any action or non reactive (non ref/reactive) property
    const { name, doubleCount } = storeToRefs(store)

    return {
      name,
      doubleCount
    }
  },
})
```

## 4.14.5 State

The state is, most of the time, the central part of your store. People often start by defining the state that represents their app. In Pinia the state is defined as a function that returns the initial state. This allows Pinia to work in both Server and Client Side.

```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

const useStore = defineStore('storeId', {
  // arrow function recommended for full type inference
  state: () => {
    return {
      // all these properties will have their type inferred automatically
      counter: 0,
      name: 'Eduardo',
      isAdmin: true,
    }
  },
})
```

> TIP

> If you are using Vue 2, the data you create in state follows the same rules as the data in a Vue instance, ie the state object must be plain and you need to call Vue.set() when adding new properties to it. See also: Vue#data.

### Accessing the state
By default, you can directly read and write to the state by accessing it through the store instance:

```js
const store = useStore()

store.counter++
Resetting the state#
You can reset the state to its initial value by calling the $reset() method on the store:

const store = useStore()

store.$reset()
```

### Usage with the options API

If you are not using the composition API, and you are using computed, methods, ..., you can use the mapState() helper to map state properties as readonly computed properties:

```js
import { mapState } from 'pinia'

export default {
  computed: {
    // gives access to this.counter inside the component
    // same as reading from store.counter
    ...mapState(useStore, ['counter'])
    // same as above but registers it as this.myOwnName
    ...mapState(useStore, {
      myOwnName: 'counter',
      // you can also write a function that gets access to the store
      double: store => store.counter * 2,
      // it can have access to `this` but it won't be typed correctly...
      magicValue(store) {
        return store.someGetter + this.counter + this.double
      },
    }),
  },
}
```

### Modifiable state

If you want to be able to write to these state properties (e.g. if you have a form), you can use mapWritableState() instead. Note you cannot pass a function like with mapState():

```js
import { mapWritableState } from 'pinia'

export default {
  computed: {
    // gives access to this.counter inside the component and allows setting it
    // this.counter++
    // same as reading from store.counter
    ...mapWritableState(useStore, ['counter'])
    // same as above but registers it as this.myOwnName
    ...mapWritableState(useStore, {
      myOwnName: 'counter',
    }),
  },
}
```

> TIP

> You don't need mapWritableState() for collections like arrays unless you are replacing the whole array with cartItems = [], mapState() still allows you to call methods on your collections.

### Mutating the state

Apart from directly mutating the store with store.counter++, you can also call the $patch method. It allows you to apply multiple changes at the same time with a partial state object:

```js
store.$patch({
  counter: store.counter + 1,
  name: 'Abalam',
})
```

However, some mutations are really hard or costly to apply with this syntax: any collection modification (e.g. pushing, removing, splicing an element from an array) requires you to create a new collection. Because of this, the $patch method also accepts a function to group this kind of mutations that are difficult to apply with a patch object:

```js
cartStore.$patch((state) => {
  state.items.push({ name: 'shoes', quantity: 1 })
  state.hasChanged = true
})
```

The main difference here is that $patch() allows you to group multiple changes into one single entry in the devtools. Note both, direct changes to state and $patch() appear in the devtools and can be time travelled (not yet in Vue 3).

### Replacing the state

You can replace the whole state of a store by setting its $state property to a new object:

```js
store.$state = { counter: 666, name: 'Paimon' }
```

You can also replace the whole state of your application by changing the state of the pinia instance. This is used during SSR for hydration.

```js
pinia.state.value = {}
```

### Subscribing to the state

You can watch the state and its changes through the $subscribe() method of a store, similar to Vuex's subscribe method. The advantage of using $subscribe() over a regular watch() is that subscriptions will trigger only once after patches (e.g. when using the function version from above).

```js
cartStore.$subscribe((mutation, state) => {
  // import { MutationType } from 'pinia'
  mutation.type // 'direct' | 'patch object' | 'patch function'
  // same as cartStore.$id
  mutation.storeId // 'cart'
  // only available with mutation.type === 'patch object'
  mutation.payload // patch object passed to cartStore.$patch()

  // persist the whole state to the local storage whenever it changes
  localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(state))
})
```

By default, state subscriptions are bound to the component where they are added (if the store is inside a component's setup()). Meaning, they will be automatically removed when the component is unmounted. If you want to keep them after the component is unmounted, pass true as the second argument to detach the state subscription from the current component:

```js
export default {
  setup() {
    const someStore = useSomeStore()

    // this subscription will be kept after the component is unmounted
    someStore.$subscribe(callback, true)

    // ...
  },
}
```

> TIP

> You can watch the whole state on the pinia instance:

```js
watch(
  pinia.state,
  (state) => {
    // persist the whole state to the local storage whenever it changes
    localStorage.setItem('piniaState', JSON.stringify(state))
  },
  { deep: true }
)
```

## 4.14.3 Basic example
This is what using pinia looks like in terms of API (make sure to check the Getting Started for complete instructions). You start by creating a store:

```js
// stores/counter.js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => {
    return { count: 0 }
  },
  // could also be defined as
  // state: () => ({ count: 0 })
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    },
  },
})
```

And then you use it in a component:

```js
import { useCounterStore } from '@/stores/counter'

export default {
  setup() {
    const counter = useCounterStore()

    counter.count++
    // with autocompletion ✨
    counter.$patch({ count: counter.count + 1 })
    // or using an action instead
    counter.increment()
  },
}
You can even use a function (similar to a component setup()) to define a Store for more advanced use cases:

export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', () => {
  const count = ref(0)
  function increment() {
    count.value++
  }

  return { count, increment }
})
```

If you are still not into `setup()` and `Composition API`, don't worry, Pinia also support a similar set of map helpers like Vuex. You define stores the same way but then use `mapStores()`, `mapState()`, or `mapActions()`:

```js
const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
  getters: {
    double: (state) => state.count * 2,
  },
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  }
})

const useUserStore = defineStore('user', {
  // ...
})

export default {
  computed: {
    // other computed properties
    // ...
    // gives access to this.counterStore and this.userStore
    ...mapStores(useCounterStore, useUserStore)
    // gives read access to this.count and this.double
    ...mapState(useCounterStore, ['count', 'double']),
  },
  methods: {
    // gives access to this.increment()
    ...mapActions(useCounterStore, ['increment']),
  },
}
```

## 4.14.4 A more realistic example

Here is a more complete example of the API you will be using with Pinia with types even in JavaScript. For some people, this might be enough to get started without reading further but we still recommend checking the rest of the documentation or even skipping this example and coming back once you have read about all of the Core Concepts.

```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const todos = defineStore('todos', {
  state: () => ({
    /** @type {{ text: string, id: number, isFinished: boolean }[]} */
    todos: [],
    /** @type {'all' | 'finished' | 'unfinished'} */
    filter: 'all',
    // type will be automatically inferred to number
    nextId: 0,
  }),
  getters: {
    finishedTodos(state) {
      // autocompletion! ✨
      return state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.isFinished)
    },
    unfinishedTodos(state) {
      return state.todos.filter((todo) => !todo.isFinished)
    },
    /**
     * @returns {{ text: string, id: number, isFinished: boolean }[]}
     */
    filteredTodos(state) {
      if (this.filter === 'finished') {
        // call other getters with autocompletion ✨
        return this.finishedTodos
      } else if (this.filter === 'unfinished') {
        return this.unfinishedTodos
      }
      return this.todos
    },
  },
  actions: {
    // any amount of arguments, return a promise or not
    addTodo(text) {
      // you can directly mutate the state
      this.todos.push({ text, id: this.nextId++, isFinished: false })
    },
  },
})
```
